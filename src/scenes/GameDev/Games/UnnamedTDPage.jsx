                  Tower defense games have always been an iconic genre. A casual
                  economy management action game. A simple task of outlasting
                  the waves with the ever increasing strength of your arsenal
                  that mystically has infinite ammo at it's disposal and
                  sometimes unchallenged aim.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  It also so happens to be one of the more arguably easier games
                  for beginner developers to transition to their novice state,
                  covering a wide range of game development concepts from
                  building logic, target searching, entity movement, state
                  management and most importantly game balancing
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  so it's no suprise that someone with dreams to become a
                  full-time game developer like me would try to take on the
                  challenge of making one.
